# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a game. I've created this mini project just for practicing web development.

Rock Paper Scissors is a game and I am sure you must have played it once in your life. 

If not let me tell you the rules, they are:
Each player needs to choose (each at a time):
Rock✊ or Paper🖐️ or Scissor✌️

Rock✊ losses to Paper🖐️,Paper🖐️ losses to Scissor✌️, Scissor✌️ losses to Rock✊.
Paper🖐️wins from Rock✊, Rock✊ wins from Scissor✌️, Scissor✌️ wins from Paper🖐️.

I have used HTML and JavaScript till now.
I will use CSS to apply designs and make it look beautiful.
